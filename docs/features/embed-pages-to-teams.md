# Embedding modern SharePoint pages to Microsoft Teams as personal apps (preview)

You can use the Microsoft Teams personal app model to pin any modern SharePoint page to the left navigation in the Microsoft Team. This provides a great opportunity to expose intranet landing pages to serve corporate communication needs, directly accessible by Microsoft Teams users. Example scenarios could include:

- Adding your corporate intranet landing page to the Microsoft Teams for easy discovery and access of news and content
- Add Learning Pathways solution to Microsoft Teams left navigation to provide easy access on the learning materials
- Add single page communications on important topics for your company

Use the steps defined in this article on embedding any modern SharePoint Portal to Microsoft Teams for easily accessing the corporate communicational information from the Microsoft Teams.

You can embed any modern page on Microsoft Teams by creating a Teams Personal App and manually create the needed configuration for this custom setup. Be aware of the following considerations.  

- This capability is provided as a preview integration path until more native solution will be available
- You must use a modern SharePoint site or page to make this work. Embedding classic publishing portals or other classic sites is not supported and will not work  
- A personal app exposing SharePoint sites and pages   can be pinned to Microsoft Teams using normal app management capabilities, which can be also controlled centrally from the Microsoft Teams admin user interface
- We do acknowledge that there are some experience gaps with this approach, including the following, which we are actively looking to address:
    - There is no navigation, headers, or footer visible natively on the embedded pages
    - Search initiated from the suite navigation bar will leverage existing Teams search results, not those configured for the pinned site
    - Content creation cannot be performed through the Microsoft Teams, rather will happen from the native SharePoint Online portal
- All users accessing the target SharePoint page will need to have at least read permissions to access the target page
- If a tenant, SharePoint site or page name or URL is changed, Teams Personal App manifest will need to be updated
- If changes are made to the pinning model for modern SP pages or sites, it could require deletion of existing pinned personal apps and redeploying 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This option is provided as a preview integration path and can evolve with a requirement to delete the existing configuration and re-adding native solution. This will not however require recreation or deletion of any content from the Microsoft Teams or from SharePoint side.  

## Embed SharePoint modern sites & pages into Microsoft Teams with App Studio 

We will be using following tags in the below steps, which you should be updating based on the SharePoint modern page or site, which you want to embed to Microsoft Teams:

- [domainUrl] – Root URL of the domain
  - Example – https://contoso.sharepoint.com
- [PageUrl] – Page, which should be shown in the tab relative to the root of the tenant
  - Example - /sites/theperspective/SitePages/Home.aspx

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking into creating a demo or sample content around this area, you can use the [https://lookbook.microsoft.com](https://lookbook.microsoft.com) service for creating sample portals for your usage.

You will need to use **App Studio** or other editor for creating the Microsoft Teams manifest file for the creating an app file with the necessary URLs to your SharePoint pages. Follow the next steps to complete the steps in App Studio.

1. Navigate to Microsoft Teams
1. Navigate to Teams store by clicking Apps on the Teams left menu

## Sample manifest of the solution

If you download the solution file from the App Studio and see the detailed configuration of the manifest file, it has the following configurations to enable it work properly in web and in desktop modes.

## Controlling app visibility in Microsoft Teams

You can also publish the app to be visible by default for all employees in your tenant by using the Teams app setup policies in the Microsoft Teams admin center. This provides you options to control which apps are visible to which users.  NOTE:  App policies do not apply to Guests of the tenant.

![teams-pp-policies](../images/teams-app-policies.png)

See more information on these options from the office Microsoft Teams documentation.

- [Manage app setup policies in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies)
